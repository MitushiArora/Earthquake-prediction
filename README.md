applying AI to earthquake prediction introduces a new set of
challenges, forming the crux of this research problem. One of the foremost
issues is data scarcity and imbalance. Earthquakes, especially high-magnitude
ones, are relatively rare events compared to the continuous background seismic
noise. This leads to highly imbalanced datasets where the number of “positive”
(earthquake) instances is far smaller than the number of “negative” (no
earthquake) instances. Training ML models on such skewed data can result in
biased predictions, with models favoring the majority class, thus missing crucial
earthquake signals.
